                <h1>Dance, Reflect & Play</h1>
                <p>Is a workshop that merges technical aspects, with games, improvisation and personal reflection,
                    connecting the body and the mind in a very delicate and fun way and linking the members of the class
                    to one another.</p>

                <p>Itâ€™s a space for fun, reflection and discovery that nurtures every member. It discourages stress or
                    pain and aims at bringing joy and health. </p>

                <p>During the class, we will work with certain tasks and choreographies that aim at practicing
                    principles of contemporary dance, such as weight, flow and isolation and then translate this work we
                    are doing to something more personal. How does the way I move connect to the way I live my life and
                    to my experiences?</p>
                    
                <p>We will also play like kids, chasing each other and racing to practice our concentration, our
                    vigilance, our cooperation and our technique, but also just to enjoy the game!</p>
                <p>We will create together and we will support one another.</p>
